# Testing Strategy for Haskell Web Application

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Haskell web application, including approaches, tools, and best practices.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

**Purpose**: Test individual functions and modules in isolation.

**Tools**:
- HUnit: Simple unit testing framework
- HSpec: BDD-style testing framework
- QuickCheck: Property-based testing

**Coverage**:
- Pure functions
- Data type operations
- Utility functions
- Business logic

**Example**:
```haskell
describe "Database operations" $ do
  it "should insert and retrieve a value" $ do
    db <- newDB
    insert db "key1" "value1"
    result <- lookup db "key1"
    result `shouldBe` Just "value1"
```

### 2. Property-Based Testing

**Purpose**: Test that functions satisfy certain properties across a wide range of inputs.

**Tools**:
- QuickCheck
- Hedgehog

**Coverage**:
- Data transformations
- Serialization/deserialization
- Business rules

**Example**:
```haskell
prop_reverseInvolutive :: [Int] -> Bool
prop_reverseInvolutive xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs
```

### 3. Integration Testing

**Purpose**: Test interactions between modules and external dependencies.

**Tools**:
- HSpec
- Hspec-wai: For testing WAI applications

**Coverage**:
- API endpoints
- Database interactions
- External service integration

**Example**:
```haskell
describe "API endpoints" $ do
  with app $ do
    describe "GET /api/status" $ do
      it "responds with 200" $ do
        get "/api/status" `shouldRespondWith` 200
```

### 4. End-to-End Testing

**Purpose**: Test the entire application flow from user perspective.

**Tools**:
- Selenium WebDriver with Haskell bindings
- Custom scripts

**Coverage**:
- Complete user journeys
- UI interactions
- System behavior

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure

```
test/
├── Spec.hs                 # Test entry point
├── AppSpec.hs              # Application tests
├── DatabaseSpec.hs         # Database tests
├── JsonSpec.hs             # JSON handling tests
└── Integration/
    ├── ApiSpec.hs          # API integration tests
    └── ExternalServicesSpec.hs
```

### Test Entry Point (Spec.hs)

```haskell
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF hspec-discover #-}
```

## Testing Practices

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Write tests before implementing features
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Focus on behavior, not implementation

### 2. Continuous Integration

- Run tests on every commit
- Maintain high test coverage
- Prevent regressions

### 3. Test Isolation

- Tests should not depend on each other
- Use fresh state for each test
- Mock external dependencies

### 4. Property-Based Testing

- Identify invariants and properties
- Test with randomly generated inputs
- Shrink counterexamples for easier debugging

## Mocking and Test Doubles

### Approaches

- Use type classes for dependencies
- Create test implementations
- Use mock libraries like hspec-expectations

### Example

```haskell
class Monad m => Database m where
  save :: Entity -> m ()
  load :: Id -> m (Maybe Entity)

-- Real implementation
instance Database IO where
  save = saveToRealDB
  load = loadFromRealDB

-- Test implementation
instance Database (State TestDB) where
  save entity = modify $ \db -> addToTestDB db entity
  load id = gets $ lookupInTestDB id
```

## Test Coverage

- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Focus on critical paths and business logic
- Use HPC (Haskell Program Coverage) to measure coverage

## Performance Testing

- Benchmark critical operations
- Use criterion for microbenchmarking
- Test under various loads

## Security Testing

- Input validation
- Authentication and authorization
- Secure data handling

## Continuous Improvement

- Review test failures regularly
- Refactor tests as code evolves
- Add tests for bugs before fixing them
