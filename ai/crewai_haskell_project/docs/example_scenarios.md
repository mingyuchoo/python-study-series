## How to Use These Examples

These example scenarios can be used as starting points for your own Haskell web application projects. When using our multi-agent system:

1. Choose a scenario that matches your needs or combine elements from multiple scenarios
2. Enter the project name and a detailed description based on the scenario
3. Let the agents collaborate to develop your Haskell web application
4. Review the generated code and documentation
5. Customize and extend as needed
