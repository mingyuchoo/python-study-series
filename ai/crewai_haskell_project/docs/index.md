## Getting Started

To get started with the Haskell Web Development Multi-Agent System:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Enter your project information in the web interface

4. Let the agents collaborate to develop your Haskell web application

5. Review and use the generated code and documentation
