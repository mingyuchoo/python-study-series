# Agent Collaboration in Rust Web Development

This document explains how the five specialized agents in our system collaborate to develop Rust web applications.

## 1. Requirements Analyzer

**Input**: Project name and description from the user

**Process**:

- Analyzes the project requirements
- Identifies functional and non-functional requirements
- Determines appropriate Rust frameworks and libraries
- Analyzes technical constraints and dependencies
- Recommends database solutions

**Output**: Comprehensive requirements document

**Collaboration Points**:

- Provides detailed specifications to the System Architect
- Clarifies requirements when questions arise from other agents

## 2. System Architect

**Input**: Requirements document from the Requirements Analyzer

**Process**:

- Creates high-level architecture design
- Defines module structure following Rust best practices
- Designs data models and type definitions
- Specifies API endpoints and their types
- Designs database schema
- Plans frontend integration

**Output**: Architecture design document

**Collaboration Points**:

- Consults with Requirements Analyzer for clarification
- Provides architecture guidance to the Rust Developer
- Advises on design patterns appropriate for Rust

## 3. Rust Developer

**Input**: Architecture design from the System Architect

**Process**:

- Sets up project structure and build system (Stack/Cabal)
- Implements core modules and data types
- Develops API endpoints and handlers
- Implements database interactions
- Creates utility functions
- Implements business logic
- Sets up configuration and environment handling

**Output**: Implementation report and code files

**Collaboration Points**:

- Consults with System Architect on implementation details
- Provides implementation details to the QA Engineer
- Addresses issues identified during testing

## 4. Quality Assurance Engineer

**Input**: Implementation report and code from the Rust Developer

**Process**:

- Designs comprehensive testing strategy
- Writes unit tests for core functions
- Implements property-based tests
- Creates integration tests for API endpoints
- Tests database interactions
- Performs error handling and edge case testing
- Validates type safety

**Output**: Testing report and test files

**Collaboration Points**:

- Reports issues to the Rust Developer
- Verifies fixes
- Provides quality metrics to the DevOps Engineer

## 5. DevOps Engineer

**Input**: Testing report from the QA Engineer

**Process**:

- Creates deployment strategy
- Sets up containerization using Docker
- Configures CI/CD pipeline scripts
- Prepares production environment configuration
- Documents scaling and performance considerations
- Sets up monitoring and logging solutions

**Output**: Deployment report and configuration files

**Collaboration Points**:

- Consults with QA Engineer on testing requirements
- Coordinates with Rust Developer on deployment requirements

## Feedback Loops

The collaboration is not strictly linear. There are feedback loops throughout the process:

1. **Requirements Refinement Loop**: System Architect may request clarification from Requirements Analyzer
2. **Design Refinement Loop**: Rust Developer may suggest architectural improvements
3. **Implementation Feedback Loop**: QA Engineer reports issues to Rust Developer
4. **Deployment Optimization Loop**: DevOps Engineer may suggest code optimizations

## Benefits of Multi-Agent Collaboration

1. **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on its area of expertise
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects of development are addressed
3. **Quality Assurance**: Multiple perspectives ensure higher quality
4. **Efficiency**: Parallel processing of different aspects
5. **Best Practices**: Each agent applies domain-specific best practices
